# TitleSafe

TitleSafe is a full stack web application built with Next.js/TypeScript on the front end, and blockchain, AWS on the backend to store data. It enables secure and transparent recording of property titles. The app allows users to tokenize property titles into NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with associated metadata. It leverages blockchain for immutable, decentralized storage of essential documents and AWS for mutable data. The app features recording of sold or bought property details and filtering titles by instrument number. It also includes a role-based access control system, allowing authorized users (like the recorder’s office) to approve titles after verifying documents and information

## Reason for Building This App

I built this project during my latest role as a front-end engineer. It’s an MVP web application for a U.S. government agency to enable more secure property title recording for homeowners, delivering a working proof of concept adopted for regional pilot testing

## Technology Used:
